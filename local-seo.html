                services could mean the difference between a thriving business and a failing establishment. Where do

                    <p>A MarketingSherpa study determined which type of search had the biggest impact on brands’
                        marketing objectives and found that almost <strong>54 percent</strong> of respondents consider
                        <strong>local search</strong> to
                        have the most positive impact on their digital marketing efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>Evidently, digital dominance has made it vital for businesses of all sizes to concentrate their
                        efforts on local SEO optimization. Local SEO for small business and multi-location firms is a
                        critical strategy for acquiring qualified leads and converting them into sales. If you don’t
                        have a local SEO strategy in place, you could be doing more harm to your business than you
                        initially realize.</p>
